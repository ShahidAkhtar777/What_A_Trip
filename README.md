# What_A_Trip

Welcome to What_A_Trip, a travel planner application that helps you find the shortest path between two cities with the option of using at most one plane in your journey. The project is built using Node.js, Express.js, and JavaScript. The application visually displays the cities, their distances, and the mode of transport (bus or plane) using yellow and green lines, respectively, on an interactive graph using vis.js.
